# Roof Material Classification

This  project  explores  different  approaches  for  multi-classsemantic segmentation of dense rural environments with Deep Convolu-tional Neural Networks (DCNNs) using partially annotated Very HighResolution (VHR) drone images of Colombia. Two major architectures,Fully Convolutional Network (FCN) and UNet architectures, along withtheir variations have been explored. Post-processing has been done usingConditional Random Fields (CRF). For handling missing annotations, aweighted loss approach has been explored that specifies the contributionof each pixel to the loss function. Experiments have been done on datacontaining 5 classes

# Roof Material Classification

This  project  explores  different  approaches  for  multi-class semantic segmentation of dense rural environments with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNNs) using partially annotated Very HighResolution (VHR) drone images of Colombia. Two major architectures, Fully Convolutional Network (FCN) and UNet architectures, along with their variations have been explored. For handling missing annotations, a weighted loss approach has been explored that specifies the contribution of each pixel to the loss function. Experiments have been done on data containing 5 classes: Concrete,  healthy  metal, irregular metal, incomplete and other type of roofing.
